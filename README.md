## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🧾 Building a **Personal Finance Tracker API** using **Spring Boot** and **AWS**  
  A comprehensive Personal Finance Management API designed to demonstrate enterprise-grade development practices — including **secure transaction processing**, **regulatory compliance**, and **cloud-native deployment** using AWS.  

- 🗺️ Developing a full-stack smart city routing platform with a live data pipeline. This project uses RabbitMQ to stream simulated traffic events to a consumer, which then updates a Neo4j graph database in real-time. A FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend then query this live graph to provide dynamic, cost-based pathfinding.

- 🏋️‍♂️ Prototyping an **AI-Powered Smart Gym Trainer**  
  A web-based system that uses **AI pose detection** to track form, count reps, and offer real-time feedback during workouts — accessible via any device with a webcam.
